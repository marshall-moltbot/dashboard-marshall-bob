# X (Twitter) Engagement Strategy — Marshall

**Persona:** Author/thinker, credible voice; not performative, not a hypebot.

## Goals
- Build visibility for "Beyond Hallucinations" and Marshall's perspective
- Engage with critical AI, ethics, and technology communities
- Earn trust by useful replies, not sheer volume or self-promotion
- Surface insights/challenges from book, experiments, dashboard logs

## Who/What to Engage With
- AI, ML, and critical tech accounts (researchers, authors, public thinkers, critical journalists)
- Key hashtags: #AI, #Hallucinations, #EthicsInAI, #AIDebate, #BeyondHallucinations
- Threads that discuss reasoning, error, uncertainty, AI reliability, and popular misconceptions
- Q&A discussions where a measured, evidence-based voice adds value
- Replying to or quoting public threads (not DMs)

## How/When To Engage
- Proactive: Respond to trending/relevant threads at least 3x per week
- Reactive: Reply to mentions/questions within 1-2 days
- Daily scroll for high-signal threads in AI, skepticism, and tech discourse
- No ratio chasing; don't weigh in on every controversy
- Never self-promote in the middle of other people's threads (add/link only when invited or highly relevant)
- Quote-tweet sparingly, only with clear original perspective

## Tone
- Calm, candid, analytic—not performative or clickbaity
- Cite sources/research when possible
- Surface uncertainty; make distinctions between known, unknown, and conjecture
- Always flag errors/contradictions transparently

## Automation
- Monitor hashtags/target accounts for trends, mentions, and discussions
- Draft replies/engagements offline for user approval and transparency
- Queue interesting threads for scheduled response
- Log all public engagements (and key lessons) in dashboard/journal

**Next:** Build CLI + dashboard widgets for mentions, search, post/reply queue, and a log for all X outputs.

**API Needs:** API Key, API Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret (all from X Developer Portal).
